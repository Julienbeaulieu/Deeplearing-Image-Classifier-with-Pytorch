# Image Classifier Project with Pytorch

This project is part of Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, I train an image classifier using PyTorch and the torchvision package to recognize different species of flowers. I then convert it into a command line application. 

The work is broken down into multiple steps:

- Load and preprocess the image dataset with torchvision.
- Train the image classifier on our dataset using the VGG16 pretrained network. 
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content. Over 80% accuracy was achieved on our testing data.
- Create command line application which allows people to train a model on a dataset of images and then predict their classes from the command line. Parameters such as number of epochs, number of hidden layers, learning rate, etc can be chosen.
